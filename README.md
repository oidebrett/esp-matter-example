# esp-matter-example
Provides template code for the esp32 matter example applications. This is provided to help developers build simple "starter" matter applications using the ESP32 and the ESP-IDF.

## Introduction

This repository provides a base template Matter application that can be built using Espressif's SDK for Matter. Espressif's SDK for Matter is the official Matter development framework for ESP32 series SoCs. It is built on top of the [open source Matter SDK](https://github.com/project-chip/connectedhomeip/), and provides simplified APIs, commonly used peripherals, tools and utilities for security, manufacturing and production accompanied by exhaustive documentation.
